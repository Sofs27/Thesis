1. Introduction
     Background:
         Air pollution, responsible for an estimated 7 million 
preventable deaths annually, affects over 90% of the global population 
with polluted air. Pollution from both natural and anthropogenic 
sources frequently transgresses national boundaries, impacting distant 
regions.
         Wildfires contribute significantly to air pollution by 
releasing particulate matter (PM) and toxic gases into the atmosphere. 
With climate change, wildfire activity is expected to increase, 
leading to greater smoke dispersal and heightened health risks across 
affected populations.

    Problem Statement:
         Although atmospheric dispersion models are commonly used for 
tracking wildfire smoke, they have limitations, such as heavy 
computational demands and discrepancies between predicted and actual 
pollution concentrations. Alternatively, remote sensing offers 
near-real-time data with products like the Fire Radiative Power (FRP) 
and Fire Radiative Energy (FRE), which allow for effective monitoring 
of wildfire emissions.

     Research Aim:
         To detect and assess wildfire pollution events using a 
combination of remote sensing, atmospheric monitoring data, and 
machine learning approaches, focusing on FRP and FRE outputs as 
indicators of wildfire-induced pollution.

     Objectives:
         -Identify key indicators from remote sensing and 
meteorological data that correlate with pollution events due to 
wildfires.
         -Develop a machine learning-based model to detect pollution 
events using data from sources like CAMS, WRF-Chem, FRP/FRE.
         -Analyze the spatial and temporal impacts of wildfire smoke 
on air quality in affected areas.
         -Analyse the impact of compound extreme events on 
wildfire-related pollution events

2. Literature Review
     Air Pollution:
         Discuss the impacts of particulate matter and toxic gases 
emitted from wildfires, with a focus on the transboundary nature of 
pollution and its exacerbation due to climate change.
     Remote Sensing in Wildfire Monitoring:
         Review remote sensing tools, including MODIS, SEVIRI, and 
Sentinel products, used in monitoring wildfire activity and emissions. 
Discuss the utility of FRE and FRP as measures of biomass combustion 
rate and their effectiveness in tracking pollution.
     Data Science in Environmental Monitoring:
         Explore data science methods in atmospheric and environmental 
sciences, including machine learning models used in pollution 
detection and forecasting.

3. Data and Methodology
     Data Collection:
         Meteorological Data: Gather atmospheric data, such as 
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, from sources like 
CAMS and monitoring stations.
         Remote Sensing Data: Use FRE and FRP data from MODIS, SEVIRI, 
and Sentinel-3 for monitoring fire radiative power and energy release.
     Data Processing:
         Integrate meteorological and remote sensing data with 
pollution monitoring station data to create a comprehensive dataset.
         Preprocess data by cleaning and transforming it to address 
missing values, noise, and scaling for model input.

    Model Development:
         Supervised Machine Learning Models: Implement and compare 
models (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) to 
classify pollution events and identify anomalies related to wildfire 
smoke.
         Spatial and Temporal Analysis: Use geospatial tools to map 
the spatial reach of pollution plumes, identifying the temporal 
dynamics of smoke dispersal patterns.

    Evaluation and Validation:
         Validate the model using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, 
and area under the curve (AUC) for classification tasks.
         Cross-reference predicted pollution events with historical 
extreme events (e.g., Portugal’s 2017 megafires) to validate spatial 
and temporal accuracy. Analyse the impact of compound events (e.g. 
droughts and heatwaves) to the magnitude of fire-driven pollution 
events.

4. Results and Discussion
     Model Performance:
         Present the results of model performance, discussing the 
predictive accuracy in detecting pollution events and identifying 
contributing factors from FRE, FRP, and meteorological data.

    Spatial and Temporal Impact Analysis:
         Discuss the spatial and temporal patterns of wildfire smoke 
distribution. Evaluate how FRP and FRE data correlate with pollutant 
concentrations across affected regions.

    Limitations and Future Improvements:
         Discuss potential limitations of the model, such as 
sensitivity to specific atmospheric conditions or data quality, and 
suggest directions for future improvement.
